# CRITICAL: this spec is the only proof we have that workspace A cannot
# read workspace B's data via raw queries. The application layer scopes
# queries with `current_workspace.X` but if RLS ever degrades (missing
# policy, FORCE OFF, session-level SET instead of LOCAL, etc.) every
# query becomes a privilege boundary leak.
#
# We DO NOT stub set_rls_workspace here. We exercise the real PostgreSQL
# row_security policies created in the initial_schema migration + the
# follow-up migrations for ai_summary_topics, question_groups, etc.
#
# When this spec fails, do NOT change the assertions to "fix" it.
# Investigate which table lost its policy.
